<h1 align="center">Welcome to BookGuru ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>
BookGuru is a books sale site, a project made by six students from Plataforma 5 Coding Bootcamp in two weeks. You can search for books, view details of each book, search by categories, add to the shopping cart, remove books from the cart and modify the quantity you're purchasing. From the shopping cart module you can see the previous orders made by the logged user. Also we have some extra options for the admin users such as edit books, promote admin rights to other users and see all the orders made by any user on the site.
